        Welcome all! For those of you are in the same situation that I was, wherein I was enrolled in a course title Witches and 
        Witchcraft in Britain 1500 - 1700, or as we often refer to it: Witches and Witchcraft in Early-Modern Britain, you may be 
        experience a great deal of difficulty managing the historical overhead and intricacies of the stories. Whether thatâ€™d be 
        keeping track of who was in power, understanding the different branches of Christianity, popular pamphlets, etc. Knowing 
        as many of the aspects of witches and witchcraft and early-modern Britain are crucial for students who want to understand 
        the context, and therefore be able to talk about this subject.
