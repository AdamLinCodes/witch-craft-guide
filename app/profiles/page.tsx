        <Card title="King James" location="/images/KingJames.jpg">
          James VI and I (James Charles Stuart; 19 June 1566 – 27 March 1625) was King of Scotland as James 
          VI from 24 July 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James I from the union of the Scottish and 
          English crowns on 24 March 1603 until his death in 1625. Although he wanted to bring about a closer 
          union, the kingdoms of Scotland and England remained individual sovereign states, with their own 
          parliaments, judiciaries, and laws, both ruled by James in personal union. James was the son of 
          Mary, Queen of Scots, and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland, 
          and thus a potential successor to all three thrones. He succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age 
          of thirteen months, after his mother was compelled to abdicate in his favour. Four different 
          regents governed during his minority, which ended officially in 1578, though he did not gain full 
          control of his government until 1583. In 1603, he succeeded Elizabeth I, the last Tudor monarch of 
          England and Ireland, who died childless. He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years, 
          a period known as the Jacobean era, until his death in 1625. After the Union of the Crowns, he based 
          himself in England (the largest of the three realms) from 1603, returning to Scotland only once, in 
          1617, and styled himself "King of Great Britain and Ireland". He was a major advocate of a single 
          parliament for England and Scotland. In his reign, the Plantation of Ulster and English colonisation 
          of the Americas began.
